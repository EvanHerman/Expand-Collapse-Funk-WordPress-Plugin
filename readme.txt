Using Expand+Collapse Funk allows for very easy placement of hidden content and a link to reveal the content. The expand and collapse functionality is widely
used across the web to free up space on a page or to place semi-important content into posts. There is no limit to the length of the hidden content. Easily include images,
YouTube/Vimeo videos or anything else you could imagine.

I originally built this plugin for the marketing department at my full time job, so a simple UI and ease of use was kept in mind throughout development.
